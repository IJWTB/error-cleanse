# Error Cleanse
A Garry's Mod addon created by Turtle (STEAM_0:0:20236119) in 2011 to hide and replace the "ERROR" model with a correctly-sized clientside model.

Modified and cleaned up in 2020 for IJWTB servers.

## Original details (December 20th, 2011):
"ErrorCleanse is a mod that replaces the traditional Error model with a new dynamic model. The replacement model scales itself to the bounds of the prop that was replaced."

Console Commands
- `ErrorCleanse_KeepColor [0/1]    |` Should the replacement retain applied colors?
- `ErrorCleanse_KeepTexture [0/1]  |` Should the replacement retain applied materials?
- `ErrorCleanse_DrawNoBounds [0/1] |` If the entity has no bounds, should it draw at all?
- `ErrorCleanse_ReplaceMissingMat  |` A test for replacing purple & black material (Experimental!)
